# Pothole-Detection-and-Alert-System
It is an innovative technological solution aimed at enhancing road safety and maintenance. It involves the development and implementation of sensors and software algorithms that can identify and detect potholes on roads. These sensors, often integrated into vehicles or installed along roadways, gather data about road conditions and irregularities. The software algorithms then analyze this data to accurately pinpoint the presence of potholes.
